# Using GraphQL Code Generator with `graphql-request` and React

This example illustrates how to use GraphQL Code Generator in a React application using the `graphql-request` GraphQL Client.

You will find the TypeScript-based codegen configuration in [`codegen.ts`](./codegen.ts).

This simple codegen configuration generates types and helpers in the [`src/gql`](./src/gql/) folder that help you to get typed GraphQL Queries and Mutations seamlessly ⚡️
