  - @graphql-codegen/visitor-plugin-common@1.17.8

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 091dfeae: Support Apollo-Client v3 by default (instead of v2), and generate React Hooks be default. HOC and Components are now disabled by default.

  Apollo Client v3 has React support integrated as part of the core package now, so that means that some imports, identifiers and usage should be updated. [You can read more about migrating to Apollo-Client v3 here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/migrating/apollo-client-3-migration/)

  That means that imports are now generated from `@apollo/client` package, including `gql` tag. React Hooks are generated by default, and HOC and Components are not generated.

  ## Migration Notes

  If you are still using the [deprecated](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo) `react-apollo` package, please set this configuration:

  ```yaml
  config:
    reactApolloVersion: 2
  ```

  If you are still using the generated React HOC, please set this additional configuration:

  ```yaml
  config:
    reactApolloVersion: 2
    withHOC: true
  ```

  If you are still using the generated React Components, please set this additional configuration:

  ```yaml
  config:
    reactApolloVersion: 2
    withComponent: true
  ```

  If you don't need the generated React Hooks (turned on by default now), please also set:

  ```yaml
  config:
    withHooks: false
  ```
