/**
 * https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/issues/7362
 *
 * Source file is read by @graphql/tools using fs.promises.readFile,
 * which means that the linebreaks are read as-is and the result will be different
 * depending on the OS: it will contain LF (\n) on Linux/MacOS and CRLF (\r\n) on Windows.
 *
 * In most scenarios that would be OK. However, gql-tag-operation is using the resulting string
 * as a TypeScript type. Which means that the string will be compared against a template literal,
 * for example:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * `
 * query a {
 *    a
 *  }
 * ` === '\n query a {\n    a\n  }\n '
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * According to clause 12.8.6.2 of ECMAScript Language Specification
 * (https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-static-semantics-trv),
 * when comparing strings, JavaScript doesn't care which linebreaks does the source file contain,
 * any linebreak (CR, LF or CRLF) is LF from JavaScript standpoint
 * (otherwise the result of the above comparison would be OS-dependent, which doesn't make sense).
 *
 * Therefore gql-tag-operation would break on Windows as it would generate
 *
 * '\r\n query a {\r\n    a\r\n  }\r\n '
 *
 * which is NOT equal to
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * `
 * query a {
 *    a
 *  }
 * `
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * Therefore we need to replace \r\n with \n in the string.
