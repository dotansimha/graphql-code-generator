'@graphql-codegen/tsgql': minor

This new plugin takes is based on the types generated by `typescript` and `typescript-resolvers` plugin.

It uses GraphQL SDL from code-files, and then defines a magic TS code that knows to match the exact string you wrote into the partial resolvers signature of the SDL you defined while keeping you aware of the entire schema.

So every SDL can live now near the resolvers, and the resolvers' signature represents only what's in the specific SDL block.
