[GraphQL Codegen 1.0 is here!](https://graphql-code-generator.com/docs/migration/from-0-18)

GraphQL Code Generator is a tool that generates code out of your GraphQL schema. Whether you are developing a frontend or backend, you can utilize GraphQL Code Generator to generate output from your GraphQL Schema and GraphQL Documents (query/mutation/subscription/fragment).

By analyzing the schema and documents and parsing it, GraphQL Code Generator can output code at a wide variety of formats, based on pre-defined templates or based on custom user-defined ones. Regardless of the language that you're using, GraphQL Code Generator got you covered.

GraphQL Code Generator lets you choose the output that you need, based on _plugins_, which are very flexible and customizable. You can also write your _plugins_ to generate custom outputs that match your needs.

You can try this tool live on your browser and see some useful examples. Check out [GraphQL Code Generator Live Examples](https://graphql-code-generator.com/#live-demo).

We currently support and maintain [these plugins](https://graphql-code-generator.com/docs/plugins/index) (TypeScript, Flow, React, Angular, MongoDB, Stencil, Reason, and some more), and there is an active community that writes and maintains custom plugins.

### Quick Start

Start by installing the basic deps of GraphQL Codegen;

    $ yarn add graphql
    $ yarn add -D @graphql-codegen/cli

GraphQL Code Generator lets you setup everything by simply running the following command:

    $ yarn graphql-codegen init

Or, with `npx`:

    $ npx graphql-codegen init

Question by question, it will guide you through the whole process of setting up a schema, selecting plugins, picking a destination of a generated file, and a lot more.

If you don't want to use the wizard, install it by yourself and create a basic `codegen.yml` configuration file, point to your schema, and pick the plugins you wish to use. 

Install CLI using `yarn`:

    $ yarn add -D @graphql-codegen/cli

And create a config like below:

```yml
schema: http://localhost:3000/graphql
generates:
  src/types.ts:
    - typescript
```

Then, run the code-generator using `graphql-codegen` command:

    $ yarn graphql-codegen

The command above may fetch (for example) the following GraphQL schema:

```graphql
type Author {
  id: Int!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  posts(findTitle: String): [Post]
}

type Post {
  id: Int!
  title: String!
  author: Author!
}

type Query {
  posts: [Post]
}

schema {
  query: Query
}
```

And generate the following TypeScript typings:

```ts
export type Maybe<T> = T | null;

/** All built-in and custom scalars, mapped to their actual values */
export type Scalars = {
  ID: string,
  String: string,
  Boolean: boolean,
  Int: number,
  Float: number,
};

export type Author = {
  __typename?: 'Author',
  id: Scalars['Int'],
  firstName: Scalars['String'],
  lastName: Scalars['String'],
  posts?: Maybe<Array<Maybe<Post>>>,
};

export type AuthorPostsArgs = {
  findTitle?: Maybe<Scalars['String']>
};

export type Post = {
  __typename?: 'Post',
  id: Scalars['Int'],
  title: Scalars['String'],
  author: Author,
};

export type Query = {
  __typename?: 'Query',
  posts?: Maybe<Array<Maybe<Post>>>,
};
```
