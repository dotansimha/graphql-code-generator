# Alerts and Notifications

GraphQL Hive supports [Slack](./integrations#slack) and Webhooks at the moment.

## Adding a channel

Think of a channel as a communication target.

- In case of Slack, a target will be a channel or a user GraphQL Hive will talk to.
- If you decide to use a webhook, you need to define an endpoint to which GraphQL Hive will send POST requests.

## Adding a notification

Notifications are sent over the Channels. Currently, we only notify you about changes in a GraphQL Schema.
