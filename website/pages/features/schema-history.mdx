# Schema and its History

Once you have pushed the schema, you will find the schema you have pushed in Hive against the respective target as seen below

![Schema Explorer](../../public/schema-explorer.png)

You will also start seeing every commit you have made in the History option in the sidebar.

Think of this like a Git diff / commit log but for GraphQL schema specifically.

This will also help you understand possible breaking changes you have made to your schema over the course of time.
