# Monitoring Operations

With Hive, you can not just persist the schema and documents but you can also measure or collect data against all your GraphQL operations and generate analytics on the same. You can do this by enabling **usage flag available** in the Hive Client.

## Requirements

- An active [token](./tokens)

[Hive Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphql-hive/client) comes with a generic client and plugins for [Envelop](https://envelop.dev) and Apollo Server.

```bash
npm install @graphql-hive/client
yarn add @graphql-hive/client
```

## Using Hive Client

### Usage options

Full configuration is available under `HiveUsagePluginOptions` interface. You can explore it through your IDE or [using unpkg](https://unpkg.com/browse/@graphql-hive/client@latest/internal/types.d.ts).

### Apollo Server

Thanks to the plugin system it's a matter of adding `hiveApollo` plugin to `ApolloServer` instance:

```typescript
import { ApolloServer } from 'apollo-server'
import { hiveApollo } from '@graphql-hive/client'

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  plugins: [
    hiveApollo({
      enabled: true,
      debug: true, // or false
      token: 'YOUR-TOKEN',
      usage: true // or { ... usage options }
    })
  ]
})
```

### Envelop

If you're not familiar with Envelop - in "short" it's a lightweight JavaScript library for wrapping GraphQL execution layer and flow, allowing developers to develop, share and collaborate on GraphQL-related plugins, while filling the missing pieces in GraphQL implementations.

Here's [more](https://github.com/dotansimha/envelop#envelop) on that topic.

```typescript
import { envelop } from '@envelop/core'
import { useHive } from '@graphql-hive/client'

const envelopProxy = envelop({
  plugins: [
    useHive({
      enabled: true,
      debug: true, // or false
      token: 'YOUR-TOKEN',
      usage: true // or { ... usage options }
    })
  ]
})
```

### Other servers

The `createHive` function creates a generic Hive Client to be used with any GraphQL flow.

The `collectUsage` method accepts the same arguments as `execute` function of graphql-js and returns a function that expects the execution result object.

- `collectUsage(args)` - should be called when a GraphQL execution starts.
- `finish(result)` (function returned by `collectUsage(args)`) - has to be invoked right after execution finishes.

```typescript
import express from 'express'
import { execute } from 'graphql'
import { graphqlHTTP } from 'express-graphql'
import { createHive } from '@graphql-hive/client'

const app = express()
const hive = createHive({
  enabled: true,
  debug: true, // or false
  token: 'YOUR-TOKEN',
  usage: true // or { ... usage options }
})

app.post(
  '/graphql',
  graphqlHTTP({
    schema: yourSchema,
    async customExecuteFn(args) {
      const finish = hive.collectUsage(args)
      const result = await execute(args)
      finish(result)
      return result
    }
  })
)
```

<Callout>
  We wrapped `execute` function with Hive and used it as a custom execute function in `express-graphql`. This is the
  easiest and closest way to control GraphQL execution.
</Callout>

## Client info

Hive enables you to assign collected operation to an actual GraphQL client (consumer).

```typescript
import { ApolloServer } from 'apollo-server'
import { hiveApollo } from '@graphql-hive/client'

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  plugins: [
    hiveApollo({
      enabled: true,
      debug: true, // or false
      token: 'YOUR-TOKEN',
      usage: {
        clientInfo(context) {
          const name = context.headers['x-graphql-client-name']
          const version = context.headers['x-graphql-client-version']

          if (name && version) {
            return { name, version }
          }

          return null
        }
      }
    })
  ],
  context({ req }) {
    return {
      headers: req.headers
    }
  }
})
```

<Callout>
  The `clientInfo` method receives a context object as the first and only argument and expects to get either `null`,
  `undefined` or `{(name, version)}` object.
</Callout>

## Excluding operations

In case you want to skip some operations, here's how to do it:

```typescript
import { ApolloServer } from 'apollo-server'
import { hiveApollo } from '@graphql-hive/client'

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  plugins: [
    hiveApollo({
      enabled: true,
      debug: true, // or false
      token: 'YOUR-TOKEN',
      usage: {
        exclude: ['unwantedOperationName', 'anotherOperationName']
      }
    })
  ]
})
```

## Using Dashboard

Once this is done, and you start collecting the analytics as relevant you will be able to find all the analytics collected in the Operations Dashboard as seen below which you can then drill into
