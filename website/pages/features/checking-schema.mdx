# Checking schema

Once you have published the schema, one of the next steps would be to check your local (or Pull Request) schema against the latest version.

Hive will give you a list of all changes, sorted by criticality level (Breaking, Dangerous, Safe) and fail the check once breaking change is detected.

## Requirements

- An active [token](./tokens)
- [Published schema](./publish-schema)

## Using Hive CLI

To check a schema, use `hive schema:check` command:

```bash
# Single GraphQL API
hive schema:check schema.graphql
# or
hive schema:check "src/*.graphql"

# Federation or Stitching
hive schema:check --service reviews schema.graphql
```

<Callout emoji="💡">In case of Federation or Stitching it's mandatory to use `--service` flag.</Callout>

## With `Usage` enabled

When [Operations Monitoring](./monitoring) is enabled, Hive is able mark breaking changes as safe based on data collected by Hive Client.

We call it Conditional Breaking Changes and the general idea is to let you decide when a breaking change is in fact breaking.

## GitHub Integration

In case you want to integrate GraphQL Hive with your GitHub repository, follow the [GitHub integration guide](./integrations#github).
