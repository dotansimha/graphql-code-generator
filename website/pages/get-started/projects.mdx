# Projects

Once you have created an organization (or you are using your personal account), the next step is to actually create a project within the account by using the "Create Project" button.

When you do this, you would see a modal like this giving you the option to key in your project name and also select the project type which you want to go with depending on your strategy.

We use this to validate and build your schema underneath since the spec varies depending on the strategy you choose
