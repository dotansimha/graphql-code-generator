# Migration to 5.0.0

## What has changed?

There was an outstanding issue with `@parcel/watcher` which prevented it to be installed in certain environments, or needed an extra amount of dependencies to be built.
This release focuses on improving the usage of `@graphql-codegen/cli` in those environments by making it an optional peer dependency.
NPM (or Yarn) will not emit errors when an optional peer dependency is missing.

## How to migrate?

To use `@graphql-codegen/cli`'s watch mode (based on @parcel/watcher) you need to provide it in a package that uses `@graphql-codegen/cli` from now on.

Start by updating your package.json

<Tabs items={['Before', 'After']}>
<Tab>
```json filename="package.json"
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@graphql-codegen/cli": "^1.0.0",
    "@graphql-codegen/typescript": "^1.0.0",
    "@graphql-codegen/typescript-operations": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```
</Tab>

<Tab>
```json filename="package.json"
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@graphql-codegen/cli": "^1.0.0",
    "@graphql-codegen/typescript": "^1.0.0",
    "@graphql-codegen/typescript-operations": "^1.0.0",
    "@parcel/watcher": "^2.1.0"
  }
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

If you had issues with `@parcel/watcher` previously, you can make NPM and Yarn silently discard any build errors, by using `optionalDependencies` instead:

<Tabs items={['Before', 'After', 'After (Alternative)']}>
<Tab>
```json filename="package.json"
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@graphql-codegen/cli": "^1.0.0",
    "@graphql-codegen/typescript": "^1.0.0",
    "@graphql-codegen/typescript-operations": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```
</Tab>

<Tab>
```json filename="package.json"
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@graphql-codegen/cli": "^1.0.0",
    "@graphql-codegen/typescript": "^1.0.0",
    "@graphql-codegen/typescript-operations": "^1.0.0"
  },
  "optionalDependencies": {
    "@parcel/watcher": "^2.1.0"
  }
}
```
</Tab>

<Tab>
```json filename="package.json"
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@graphql-codegen/cli": "^1.0.0",
    "@graphql-codegen/typescript": "^1.0.0",
    "@graphql-codegen/typescript-operations": "^1.0.0",
    "@parcel/watcher": "^2.1.0"
  },
  "dependenciesMeta": {
    "@parcel/watcher": {
      "optional": true
    }
  }
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
