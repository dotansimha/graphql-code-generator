# GraphQL-CLI Deprecation

The `GraphQL-CLI` is no longer maintained, and we recommend using the `GraphQL-Codegen` CLI directly instead.

<Callout type="warning">The plugin `@graphql-cli/codegen` is deprecated, and no longer maintained!</Callout>

## Migrating from GraphQL-CLI to Codegen CLI

The Codegen plugin for `GraphQL-CLI` was wrapping the commands implemented in GraphQL-CLI, in order to provide a unified experience. You can switch to use GraphQL-Codegen CLI directly.

Remove `@graphql-cli/codegen` and [install the GraphQL Codegen CLI (`@graphql-codegen/cli`)](/docs/getting-started/installation). Then migration your commands to use the Codegen CLI directly:

Before:

```
graphql generate
```

After:

```
graphql-codegen
```
