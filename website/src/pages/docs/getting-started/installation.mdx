# Quick Start

Make sure that you add both the `graphql` and `@graphql-codegen/cli` packages in your project's dependencies:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i graphql
npm i -D typescript @graphql-codegen/cli
```

If you want [watch mode](/docs/getting-started/development-workflow#watch-mode) support you need to add `@parcel/watcher` as well:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i -D @parcel/watcher
```

## Global Installation

Please avoid installing `graphql`, `@graphql-codegen/cli`, and its plugins as global dependencies. This will cause issues because of duplications of the `graphql` package. Install it only locally in your project.

## Monorepo Project

If you are using Monorepo setup (Yarn or pnpm Workspaces), please note that GraphQL Codegen is using `require` to load plugins and files. This might break and fail in case of hoisting.

If you are having issues with loading GraphQL-Codegen plugins, make sure it's installed correctly, at the same level of `node_modules`, and make sure it's accessible and available for the Codegen CLI.

## Setup

GraphQL Code Generator comes with dozens of plugins, from frontend to backend, from web apps to mobile apps.
We recommend looking at the [guides](#manual-setup) or trying the [initialization wizards](#initialization-wizard)

Otherwise, you can start exploring the [plugins](/plugins) and [setting up them manually](#manual-setup).

## Initialization Wizard

Once installed, GraphQL Code Generator CLI can help you configure your project based on some popular flows:

```sh
npx graphql-code-generator init
```

```sh npm2yarn
npm install # install the chosen packages
```

Question by question, it will guide you through the whole process of setting up a schema, selecting and installing plugins, picking a destination to where your files are generated, and a lot more.

## Manual Setup

Once GraphQL Code Generator is installed and added to your project's development workflow (scripts), you can start installing plugins and configuring them.

If you are looking for the **best way to leverage GraphQL Code Generator on your stack**, you should read one of our _Guides_.
