# Development workflow

GraphQL Code Generator should be integrated as part of your development workflow.

## Scripts Integration

If you wish to run the codegen before starting your server/app, you can use `pre` scripts in your `package.json`, for example:

```json filename="package.json" {6-7}
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon app.js",
    "start": "node app.js",
    "generate": "graphql-codegen",
    "prestart": "yarn generate",
    "predev": "yarn generate"
  }
}
```

This way, the codegen generates the output according to your configuration before each time you run `dev` or `start` scripts.

It's also helpful to run the codegen during your continuous integration flow and ensure that your code continually compiles with the generated output; this way, you can detect breaking changes in your GraphQL schema and GraphQL documents.

## Watch Mode

If you wish to run the codegen in watch mode, you can specify `--watch` (or `-w`) when running it.

You can either run it in a separate terminal session or use tools like [`concurrently`](https://npmjs.com/package/concurrently) to run two scripts at the same time:

```json {3} /--watch/
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "concurrently \"nodemon app.js\" \"yarn generate --watch\"",
    "start": "node app.js",
    "generate": "graphql-codegen",
    "prestart": "yarn generate"
  }
}
```

If you wish, you can specify a custom list of files to watch, by adding a glob expression to the command, using `--watch` flag:

```sh /"src/**/*.js"/
yarn graphql-codegen --watch "src/**/*.js"
```

Use this when you are loading your schema or documents from a single code file that depends on other files internally because codegen can't tell that you're using those files automatically.

We use [`@parcel/watcher`](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/watcher) which supports subscribing to realtime notifications of changes in a directory. It works recursively, so changes in sub-directories will also be emitted.

```ts {6-10}
import { CodegenConfig } from '@graphql-codegen/cli'

const config: CodegenConfig = {
  schema: 'http://localhost:4000/graphql',
  // ...
  watch: true
}

export default config
```

## Handle Merge Conflicts

If you check generated files under source control, you'll probably end up dealing with merge conflicts. Those conflicts are easy to resolve because all you have to do is to generate those files again, but still, having to resolve those conflicts manually could be quite disruptive.

To avoid that, you can define a [custom merge driver](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes#_defining_a_custom_merge_driver) and let Git handle it for you!

The first thing we need to do, is to define a custom merge driver in your `.gitconfig` file. Ideally, we would like also to install fresh dependencies to make sure we're using the latest version of the codegen, so we'll use `yarn install` (or your alternative command) as part of the merge driver, then the command used to generate the files, in this context: `yarn generate`:

```ini filename=".gitconfig"
[merge "graphql-codegen"]
    name = "graphql codegen merge driver"
    driver = yarn install && yarn generate
```

Finally, we need to associate the merge driver with the generated files. We can do that by adding the following to your `.gitattributes` file:

```ini filename=".gitattributes"
__generated_graphql_types__/** merge=graphql-codegen
```

From now on, every time Git encounter a merge conflict related to the generated files, it will run our custom merge driver behind the scene. You won't even notice it anymore!

## Monorepo and Yarn Workspaces

If you are using a monorepo structure, with tools such as [Yarn Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces) or [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna), we recommend installing the codegen in the root of your monorepo.

If you need to execute the codegen multiple times, note that you can specify multiple fields for `generates` field, for example:

```ts {7-8}
import { CodegenConfig } from '@graphql-codegen/cli'

const config: CodegenConfig = {
  schema: 'server/src/**/*.graphql',
  documents: 'client/src/**/*.graphql',
  generates: {
    'client/src/models.ts': ['typescript', 'typescript-operations'],
    'server/src/models.ts': ['typescript', 'typescript-resolver']
  }
}

export default config
```
