# Development workflow

GraphQL Code Generator should be integrated as part of your development workflow.

## Scripts Integration

If you wish to run the codegen before starting your server/app, you can use `pre` scripts in your `package.json`, for example:

```json filename="package.json" {6-7}
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon app.js",
    "start": "node app.js",
    "generate": "graphql-codegen",
    "prestart": "yarn generate",
    "predev": "yarn generate"
  }
}
```

This way, the codegen generates the output according to your configuration before each time you run `dev` or `start` scripts.

It's also helpful to run the codegen during your continuous integration flow and ensure that your code continually compiles with the generated output; this way, you can detect breaking changes in your GraphQL schema and GraphQL documents.

## Watch Mode

If you wish to run the codegen in watch mode, you can specify `--watch` (or `-w`) when running it.

You can either run it in a separate terminal session or use tools like [`concurrently`](https://npmjs.com/package/concurrently) to run two scripts at the same time:

```json {3} /--watch/
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "concurrently \"nodemon app.js\" \"yarn generate --watch\"",
    "start": "node app.js",
    "generate": "graphql-codegen",
    "prestart": "yarn generate"
  }
}
```

If you wish, you can specify a custom list of files to watch, by adding a glob expression to the command, using `--watch` flag:

```sh /"src/**/*.js"/
yarn graphql-codegen --watch "src/**/*.js"
```

Use this when you are loading your schema or documents from a single code file that depends on other files internally because codegen can't tell that you're using those files automatically.

By default, watch mode uses the system's native support to listen for file change events. This can be configured in the settings file to use a stat polling method instead of in unusual cases where system support is unavailable.

```ts {6-10}
import { CodegenConfig } from '@graphql-codegen/cli'

const config: CodegenConfig = {
  schema: 'http://localhost:4000/graphql',
  // ...
  watch: true,
  watchConfig: {
    // Passed directly through to chokidar's file watch configuration
    usePolling: true,
    interval: 1000
  }
}

export default config
```

## Monorepo and Yarn Workspaces

If you are using a monorepo structure, with tools such as [Yarn Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces) or [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna), we recommend installing the codegen in the root of your monorepo.

If you need to execute the codegen multiple times, note that you can specify multiple fields for `generates` field, for example:

```ts {7-8}
import { CodegenConfig } from '@graphql-codegen/cli'

const config: CodegenConfig = {
  schema: 'server/src/**/*.graphql',
  documents: 'client/src/**/*.graphql',
  generates: {
    'client/src/models.ts': ['typescript', 'typescript-operations'],
    'server/src/models.ts': ['typescript', 'typescript-resolver']
  }
}

export default config
```
