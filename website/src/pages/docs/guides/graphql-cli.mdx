## Migrating from GraphQL-CLI to Inspector CLI

GraphQL-CLI was wrapping the commands implemented in GraphQL-Inspector, in order to provide a unified experience. You can switch to using GraphQL-Inspector directly.
You can visit [Migrating from GraphQL-CLI to Inspector CLI](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/inspector/docs/migration-guides/from-graphql-cli) documentation.
