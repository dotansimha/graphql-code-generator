# Generated files colocation

**Note for back-end use-cases**

This page covers the `@graphql-codegen/near-operation-file-preset` preset, which only applies to front-end projects.

For similar results on a back-end project, please refer to [`@graphql-codegen/graphql-modules-preset ` with the `useGraphQLModules: false{:ts}` flag](/plugins/graphql-modules-preset).

</Callout>

Most GraphQL Code Generator configuration examples (in guides or plugins documentation) generate types in a single common file, as follows:

```ts
// @ts-ignore
import { CodegenConfig } from '@graphql-codegen/cli';

// Configuration for a React URQL setup
const config: CodegenConfig = {
  schema: 'http://my-graphql-api.com/graphql',
  documents: './src/**/*.tsx',
  generates: {
    'graphql/generated.ts': {
      plugins: ['typescript', 'typescript-operations', 'typescript-urql'],
      config: { withHooks: true },
    },
  },
};
export default config;
```

All code is generated in one single `graphql/generated.ts` file.

However, you might prefer to have those types generated in files near the original GraphQL operations, as follows:

```
src/
  components/
    posts/
      posts.generated.tsx
      Posts.tsx
  # …
```

`posts.generated.tsx` contains the generated code for the GraphQL query used in `Posts.tsx`.

Just a few configuration steps are required to get this structure of colocated generated files:

### Install

```sh npm2yarn
npm i -D @graphql-codegen/near-operation-file-preset
```

### Configure the preset

To use this preset, you need to add 2 outputs to your `codegen.ts` file:

- The first is the base types, generated by `typescript` plugin.
- The second is the one in charge of generating types per operation.


```ts filename="codegen.ts"
// @ts-ignore
import { CodegenConfig } from '@graphql-codegen/cli';

const config: CodegenConfig = {
  schema: 'http://my-graphql-api.com/graphql',
  documents: 'src/**/!(*.generated).{ts,tsx}',
  generates: {
    'src/types.ts': {
      plugins: ['typescript'],
    },
    'src/': {
      preset: 'near-operation-file',
      presetConfig: { extension: '.generated.tsx', baseTypesPath: 'types.ts' },
      plugins: ['typescript-operations', 'typescript-urql'],
      config: { withHooks: true },
    },
  },
};
export default config;
```

**`schema` and `documents` values**

`schema` needs to be your target GraphQL API URL (`"/graphql"` included).

`documents` is a glob expression to your `.graphql`, `.ts` or `.tsx` files.

</Callout>

<Callout>
If you're loading your `documents` from files with the same extension as the generated files, make sure the glob you use excludes the generated files. For example, if your original glob was `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}`, use `src/**/!(*.generated).{ts,tsx}` instead.
</Callout>

### Run the codegen and update your code

Assuming that, as recommended, your `package.json` has the following script:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "generate": "graphql-codegen"
  }
}
```

Running the following generates the colocated `.generated.tsx` file.

```sh npm2yarn
npm run generate
```

For more advanced configuration, please refer to the [`@graphql-codegen/near-operation-file-preset` documentation](/plugins/near-operation-file-preset).
