## TL;DR

The `flutter-freezed` plugin generates Freezed models from a GraphQL Schema.

## Motivation

> Dart is awesome, but defining a "model" can be tedious. We may have to:
>
> - define a constructor + the properties
> - override toString, operator ==, hashCode
> - implement a copyWith method to clone the object
> - handling de/serialization
>
> On top of that, Dart is also missing features such as union types and pattern-matching.
>
> Implementing all of this can take hundreds of lines, which are error-prone and the readability of your model significantly.
>
> Freezed tries to fix that by implementing most of this for you, allowing you to focus on the definition of your model.

Fortunately enough, GraphQL is strongly typed, and so is Dart.
Save yourself from implementing a model to match your strongly typed GraphQL types, and let Freezed handle the work while you chill with this `flutter-freezed`plugin

## Features
Currently, the plugin  supports the following features
- [x] Generate Freezed classes for ObjectTypes
- [x] Generate Freezed classes for InputTypes
- [x] Support for EnumsTypes
- [x] Support for custom ScalarTypes
- [x] Support freeze documentation of class & properties from GraphQL SDL description comments
- [x] Ignore/don't generate freezed classes for certain ObjectTypes
- [x] Support directives
- [x] Support deprecation annotation
- [x] ~~Support for InterfaceTypes~~
- [x] Support for UnionTypes [union/sealed classes](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed#unionssealed-classes)
- [x] Merge InputTypes with ObjectType as union/sealed class [union/sealed classes](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed#unionssealed-classes)

## Usage

Since this plugin as well as the `graphql-code-generator` is written in JS/TS, and this plugin would likely be used in a Dart environment, you have 2 options:

- (WIP) The flutter-freezed-cli
- A NodeJS project

### The flutter-freezed-cli
This is currently in progress. Upon it completion, you can install and run the generator globally.

A PR would also be grately appreciated for using `build-runner` instead of a cli written in JS

### NodeJS project
Follow the [Installation Guide](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/docs/getting-started/installation) for more details on getting started

1. Create a new NodeJS project
2. Install the `graphql-code-generator` and the `flutter-freezed` plugin
3. Add your `codegen.yml` to the root of your project and
4. simply run `codegen init`
5. Copy and paste the output into your flutter project.
6. Enjoy

```bash
```
