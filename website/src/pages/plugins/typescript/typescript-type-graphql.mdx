This plugin is similar to the basic TypeScript plugin. However, this package generates types that can be used by TypeGraphQL to generate a GraphQL schema. This is especially useful if you are building a service that is a gateway to multiple downstream GraphQL services, or otherwise combining GraphQL schemas. In this case, this plugin can be used to re-expose types defined in downstream GraphQL services without redefining them as TypeGraphQL objects. This plugin should be compatible with other client-side plugins, such as typescript-operations.

Some differences with the types generated by the basic TypeScript plugin:

- classes are generated instead of interfaces
- TypeGraphQL decorators like `@ObjectType` and `@Field` will be added
