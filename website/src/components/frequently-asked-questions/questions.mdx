## Frequently asked questions

- What does "no vendor lock" mean?

  We value your flexibility and independent decision-making. That means we'll never try to lock you
  out in our ecosystem and we'll continuously add support for other tools and solutions, so that you
  decide what your stack should look like!

- Can GraphQL Hive be self-hosted?

  Yes, the on-premise version (identical to Hive Cloud) is free and open-source.
  [Read about Self-Hosting Hive in our documentation](/docs/self-hosting/get-started).

- What counts as a GraphQL operation?

  Every GraphQL request that is processed by your GraphQL API and reported to GraphQL Hive. If your
  server receives 1M GraphQL requests, all of them will be reported to Hive (assuming no sampling).

- Are you SOC-2 Type II complaint?

  We are currently about to finish the process of being SOC-2 Type II complaint and getting the
  certificate.

- Do you have a GraphQL Gateway?

  Of course, we do! It is called Hive Gateway (previously known as GraphQL Mesh) that supports
  Apollo Federation and has been battle-tested by our clients for a few years now.
