{@operationsNote}

These plugins generate a ready-to-use `TypedDocumentNode` (a combination of pre-compiled `DocumentNode` and the TypeScript signature it represents).

With the `typed-document-node` plugin you no longer need to reconfigure, and install different GraphQL Code Generator plugins to manage all your GraphQL client hooks. Generate a single `TypedDocumentNode` and pass it to your GraphQL client of choice.

This plugin also generates less boilerplate code for your GraphQL operations.

> Watch [Episode #41 of `graphql.wtf`](https://graphql.wtf/episodes/41-typed-document-node) for a quick introduction to using this plugin with GraphQL Code Generator:

### Usage example

```yaml
schema: SCHEMA_FILE_OR_ENDPOINT_HERE
documents: './src/**/*.graphql'
generates:
  ./src/graphql-operations.ts:
    plugins:
      - typescript
      - typescript-operations
      - typed-document-node
```

The example about will generate `TypedDocumentNode` with the needed types built-in, for example:

```ts
// Represents the variables type of the operation - generated by `typescript` + `typescript-operations` plugins
export type RatesQueryVariables = Exact<{
  currency: Scalars['String'];
}>;

// Represents the result type of the operation - generated by `typescript` + `typescript-operations` plugins
export type RatesQuery = (
  { __typename?: 'Query' }
  & {
  rates?: Maybe<Array<Maybe<(
    { __typename?: 'ExchangeRate' }
    & Pick<ExchangeRate, 'currency' | 'rate'>
    )>>>
}
  )

// Generated by this plugin - creates a pre-compiled `DocumentNode` and passes result type and variables type as generics
export const ratesQuery: TypedDocumentNode<RatesQuery, RatesQueryVariables> = {
  kind: 'Document',
  definitions: [
    {
      kind: 'OperationDefinition',
      operation: 'query',
      name: { ... }
    }
  ]
}
```

> This plugin also requires `typescript` and `typescript-operations`.
