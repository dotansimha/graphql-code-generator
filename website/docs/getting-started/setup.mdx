GraphQL Code Generator comes with dozen of plugins, from front-end to back-end, from web-apps to mobile-apps.
If you are not sure which plugins might be useful for your GraphQL stack, give a try at the [_Initialization Wizard_](#initialization-wizard).

Otherwise, you can start exploring the [plugins](/plugins) and [setting up them manually](#manual-setup).


## Initialization Wizard

GraphQL Code Generator can help you configure your project based on some popular flows:


<PackageRun scripts={['graphql-codegen init', 'install # install the choose plugins']} />


Question by question, it will guide you through the whole process of setting up a schema, selecting and installing plugins, picking a destination to where your files are generated, and a lot more.

The init process above can also be run through `npx`.

## Manual Setup

If you wish to configure codegen manually, please start by creating a `codegen.yml` file in your project's root directory:

```yaml
schema: schema.graphql # you can also point to a GraphQL endpoint!
generates:
  types.ts:
    plugins:
      - @graphql-codegen/typescript
```

GraphQL Code Generator's behavior is bound into plugins, thus we will need to install one of them, for example, if you are using `@graphql-codegen/typescript` plugin, please make sure install it locally in your project

Although this can be used directly, it's recommended to add the code generation script to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "generate": "graphql-codegen"
  }
}
```

This will simplify its usage, and you'll be able to run the codegen with the following command: `npm run generate`.

You can learn more about [`codegen.yml` and the available configurations here](/docs/getting-started/config-reference/codegen-config), and [you can find a list of all available plugins here](/plugins)
