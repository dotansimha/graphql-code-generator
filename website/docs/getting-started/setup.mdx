GraphQL Code Generator comes with dozen of plugins, from front-end to back-end, from web-apps to mobile-apps.
If you are not sure which plugins might be useful for your GraphQL stack, give a try at the [_Initialization Wizard_](#initialization-wizard).

Otherwise, you can start exploring the [plugins](/plugins) and [setting up them manually](#manual-setup).

## Initialization Wizard

Once installed, GraphQL Code Generator CLI can help you configure your project based on some popular flows:


<PackageRun scripts={['graphql-codegen init', 'install # install the choose plugins']} />


Question by question, it will guide you through the whole process of setting up a schema, selecting and installing plugins, picking a destination to where your files are generated, and a lot more.

The init process above can also be run through `npx`.

## Manual Setup

Once GraphQL Code Generator installed and added to your project's development workflow (scripts), you can start installing plugins and configuring them.

If you are looking for the **best way to leverage GraphQL Code Generator on your stack**, you should definitely read one of our _Guides_.

On top of each plugin documentation, we provide one Guide for the most famous framework such as [React](/docs/guides/react) or [Apollo Server](/docs/guides/graphql-server-apollo-yoga).
Each Guides expose the best plugins and configurations available for each framework and stack (React with Apollo / URQL / React Query, Angular with Apollo, ...).

Otherwise, if you **prefer exploring plugins and skipping the high-level explanations**, the go-to ressources will be the [plugins documentation](/plugins) and the [`codegen.yaml` API reference documentation](/docs/config-reference/codegen-config).
