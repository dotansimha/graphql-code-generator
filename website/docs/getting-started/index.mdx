title: Introduction to GraphQL Code Generator
---

GraphQL Code Generator is a tool that provides a set of plugins that will help you get the best of your GraphQL stack.

From back-end to front-end, GraphQL Code Generator will automate the generation of:

- **Typed Queries, Mutations and Subscriptions** for React, Vue, Angular, Next.js, Svelte, whether you are using Apollo Client, URQL or React Query.
- **Typed GraphQL resolvers**, for any Node.js (GraphQL Yoga, GraphQL Modules, TypeGraphQL or Apollo) or Java GraphQL server.
- **Full-typed Node.js SDKs, Apollo Android** support, and more!

## The perfect GraphQL Developer Experience

To illustrate how GraphQL Code Generator improves your Developer Experience, let's take a look the following schema and its usage in a front-end application:

```graphql
# schema.graphql

type Author {
  id: Int!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  posts(findTitle: String): [Post]
}

type Post {
  id: Int!
  title: String!
  author: Author
}

type Query {
  posts: [Post]
}
```

Most React Apollo / URQL component would query the API as follows:

```tsx
import { postsQuery } from './graphql/generated'

// `postsQuery` is a fully typed GraphQL Document Node!

const Posts = () => {
  const { data } = useQuery(postsQuery)

  // `data` is fully typed and in-sync with the last Schema version!

  // ...
}
```

However, not typing or manually maintaining the data-types can lead to many issues:


  - **outdated typing** (regarding the current Schema)

  - **typos**

  - **partial typing** of data (not all Schema&apos;s fields has a corresponding type)


The strength of your front-end application types is based on your data types, therefore, any mistake on your
manually maintained data types will ripple in many of your components.


For this reason, automating and generating the typing of your GraphQL operations will both improve the developer
experience and stability of your stack.

After a few steps to [install](/docs/getting-started/installation) and [configure](/docs/config-reference/codegen-config) GraphQL Code Generator, our front-end code will be fully-typed and
up-to-date as follows:


```tsx
import { postsQuery } from './graphql/generated'

// `postsQuery` is a fully typed GraphQL Document Node!

const Posts = () => {
  const { data } = useQuery(postsQuery)

  // `data` is fully typed and in-sync with the last Schema version!

  // ...
}
```

Now, with a simple configuration and a npm/yarn script, the front-end developers will benefit from:


  - **up-to-date typings**


  - **autocompletion on all queries, mutations and subscription variables and results**


  - **less boilerplate** (thanks to full code generation such as React hooks generation)

GraphQL Code Generator is not limited to the generation of type-safe operations on the client-side.

Many other plugins helps in generating typings for GraphQL servers resolvers ([Node.js](/plugins/typescript-resolvers) and [Java](/plugins/java-resolvers)), type-safe
[GraphQL requests for Apollo Android](/plugins/java-apollo-android) or full typed [TypeScript SDK](/plugins/typescript-generic-sdk)!
