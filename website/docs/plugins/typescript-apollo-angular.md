This plugin generates Apollo services (`Query`, `Mutation` and `Subscription`) with TypeScript typings.

It will generate a strongly typed Angular service for every defined query, mutation or subscription. The generated Angular services are ready to inject and use within your Angular component.

To shed some more light regards this template, it's recommended to go through the ["Query, Mutation, Subscription services"](http://apollographql.com/docs/angular/basics/services.html) chapter of Apollo Angular docs and to read the ["Code Generation with Apollo Angular"](https://the-guild.dev/blog/apollo-angular-12) article.

## Installation

    $ yarn add -D @graphql-codegen/typescript-apollo-angular

## How to use?

Simply create a `.graphql` file and write a random query like so:

```graphql
query MyFeed {
  feed {
    id
    commentCount
  }
}
```

Using `graphql-codegen` you can generate a file with typesand services that you can use when coding an Angular component:

```yaml
# ...
generates:
  path/to/output.ts:
    plugins:
      - typescript
      - typescript-operations
      - typescript-apollo-angular
```

Then, use it:

```ts
import { MyFeedGQL, MyFeedQuery } from './graphql';

@Component({
  selector: 'feed',
  template: `
    <h1>Feed:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li *ngFor="let item of feed | async">{{ item.id }}</li>
    </ul>
  `,
})
export class FeedComponent {
  feed: Observable<MyFeedQuery['feed']>;

  constructor(feedGQL: MyFeedGQL) {
    this.feed = feedGQL.watch().valueChanges.pipe(map(result => result.data.feed));
  }
}
```

#### `@NgModule` directive

All generated services are defined with `@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })` and in most cases you don't need to overwrite it, because providing a service to the root injector is highly recommended. To customize that behavior you can use `@NgModule` directive, anywhere in an operation, to let the codegen know which injector should it use to create a service.

> You can't use multiple `@NgModule` directives in the same operation

```graphql
query feed {
  feed @NgModule(module: "./feed/feed.module#FeedModule") {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

#### `@namedClient` directive

Sometimes you end up with multiple Apollo clients, which means part of operations can't use the defauls. In order to customize that behavior you simply attach the `@namedClient` directive and the `typescript-apollo-angular` plugin takes care of the rest.

> You can't use multiple `@namedClient` directives in the same operation

```graphql
query feed {
  feed @namedClient(name: "custom") {
    id
    title
  }
}
```
