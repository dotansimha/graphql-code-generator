This plugin is similar to the basic TypeScript plugin. However, this package generates types that can be used by TypeGraphQL to generate a GraphQL schema. This is especially useful if you are building a service that is a gateway to multiple downstream GraphQL services, or otherwise combining GraphQL schemas. In this case, this plugin can be used to re-expose types defined in downstream GraphQL services without redefining them as TypeGraphQL objects. This plugin should be compatible with other client-side plugins, such as typescript-operations.

Some differences with the the types generated by the basic TypeScript plugin:

- classes are generated instead of interfaces
- TypeGraphQL decorators like @ObjectType and @Field will be added

{@import ../generated-config/typescript-type-graphql.md}
