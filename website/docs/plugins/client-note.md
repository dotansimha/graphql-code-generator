:::caution Usage Requirements

In order to use this GraphQL Codegen plugin, please make sure that you have GraphQL operations (`query` / `mutation` / `subscription` and `fragment`) set as `documents: ...` in your `codegen.yml`.

Without loading your GraphQL operations (query, mutation, subscription and fragment), you won't see any change in the generated output.
