:::info Note for back-end use-cases

This page covers the `@graphql-codegen/near-operation-file-preset` preset, which only applies to front-end projects.

For similar results on a back-end project, please refer to [`@graphql-codegen/graphql-modules-preset
` with the `useGraphQLModules: false` flag](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/plugins/graphql-modules-preset).

<p>&nbsp;</p>


Most GraphQL Code Generator configuration examples (in guides or plugins documentation) generate types in a single common file, as follows:


```yaml
# Configuration for a React URQL setup

schema: http://my-graphql-api.com/graphql
documents: './src/**/*.tsx'
generates:
  graphql/generated.ts:
    plugins:
      - typescript
      - typescript-operations
      - typescript-urql
    config:
      withHooks: true
```

All code is generated in one single `graphql/generated.ts` file.


However, you might prefer to have those types generated in files near the original GraphQL operations, as follows:


```
src/
   components/
      posts/
        posts.generated.tsx
        Posts.tsx
   #...
```

`posts.generated.tsx` contains the generated code for the GraphQL query used in `Posts.tsx`.


<p>&nbsp;</p>

Just a few configuration steps are required to get this structure of colocated generated files:

**1. Install the `@graphql-codegen/near-operation-file-preset` preset**

<PackageInstall packages={["@graphql-codegen/near-operation-file-preset"]} />

<br />

**2. Configure the preset**

To use this preset, you need to add 2 outputs to your codegen.yml file:

- The first is the base types, generated by `typescript` plugin.
- The second is the one in charge of generating types per operation.

<br />


```yaml
schema: http://my-graphql-api.com/graphql
# we are looking for operations in .tsx files,
#   but not the generated ones.
documents: 'src/**/!(*.generated).{ts,tsx}'
generates:
  src/types.ts:
    - typescript
  src/:
    preset: near-operation-file
    presetConfig:
      extension: .generated.tsx
      baseTypesPath: types.ts
    plugins:
      - typescript-operations
      - typescript-urql
    config:
      withHooks: true
```


:::tip `schema` and `documents` values
`schema` needs to be your target GraphQL API URL (`"/graphql"` included).

`documents` is a glob expression to your `.graphql`, `.ts` or `.tsx` files.
:::


> Note: If you're loading your `documents` from files with the same extension as the generated files, make sure the glob you use excludes the generated files. For example, if your original glob was `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}`, use `src/**/!(*.generated).{ts,tsx}` instead.


<br />

**3. Run the codegen and update your code**

Assuming that, as recommended, your `package.json` has the following script:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "generate": "graphql-codegen",
  }
}
```

<br />

Running the following generates the colocated `.generated.tsx` file.

<PackageRun scripts={['generate']} />

<br />
