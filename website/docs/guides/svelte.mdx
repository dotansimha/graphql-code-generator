GraphQL Code Generator is currently only providing a plugin for Svelte and Apollo.

In order to get typed Queries with Svelte outside of Apollo, please refer to the ["TypeScript-only for front-end" guide](/docs/guides/front-end-typescript-only).

## Svelte Apollo

Thank to the [community-built plugin](https://github.com/ticruz38/graphql-codegen-svelte-apollo#readme) `graphql-codegen-svelte-apollo`, GraphQL Code Generator  generates full-typed observable Apollo queries for Svelte.

Taking the following schema:

```graphql
# schema.graphql

type Author {
  id: Int!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  posts(findTitle: String): [Post]
}

type Post {
  id: Int!
  title: String!
  author: Author
}

type Query {
  posts: [Post]
}
```

and the following reference script:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { query } from "svelte-apollo";

  const postsQueryDocument = gql`
    query Posts {
      posts {
          id
          title
          author {
            id
            firstName
            lastName
          }
      }
    }
  `

  const posts = query(postsQueryDocument);
</script>

<ul>
    { /* UI */ }
</ul>
```

Just a few configuration steps are required to get observable Apollo queries with Typescript typings:

**1. Install the `graphql-codegen-svelte-apollo` plugin**

<PackageInstall packages={["graphql-codegen-svelte-apollo", "@graphql-codegen/typescript", "@graphql-codegen/typescript-operations"]} />

<br />

**2. Configure the plugin**

Create or update your `codegen.yaml` file as follows:

```yaml
schema: http://my-graphql-api.com/graphql
documents: './src/**/*.tsx'
generates:
  ./graphql/generated.ts:
    plugins:
      - typescript
      - typescript-operations
      - graphql-codegen-svelte-apollo
```

:::tip `schema` and `documents` values
`schema` needs to be your target GraphQL API URL (`"/graphql"` included).

`documents` is a glob expression to your `.graphql`, `.ts` or `.tsx` files.
:::

<br />

**3. Run the codegen and update your code**

Assuming that, as recommended, your `package.json` has the following script:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "generate": "graphql-codegen",
  }
}
```

<br />

Running the following will generate the `graphql/generated.tsx` file.

<PackageRun scripts={['generate']} />

<br />

We can now update our code as follows:


```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Posts } from "../graphql/generated";

  // `posts` is fully typed, also are `Posts()` options!
  const posts = Posts();
</script>

<ul>
    { /* UI */ }
</ul>
```
