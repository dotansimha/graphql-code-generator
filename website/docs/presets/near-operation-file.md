This preset generates a file per each operation file.

## Installation

    $ yarn add @graphql-codegen/near-operation-file-preset

## Example

In order to use this preset, you need to add 2 outputs to your `codegen.yml` file:

- The first, is the base types, generated by `typescript` plugin.
- The second, is the one that in charge of generating types per operation.

This following example generates operation typings and `react-apollo` component per each operation file, near the original file of the operation:

```yml
schema: src/schema.json
documents: 'src/**/*.graphql'
generates:
  src/types.ts:
    - typescript
  src/:
    preset: near-operation-file
    presetConfig:
      extension: .generated.tsx
      baseTypesPath: types.ts
    plugins:
      - typescript-operations
      - typescript-react-apollo
```

**How does it work?**

The first output is simple, and it only generates the base schema types to `src/types.ts`.

The second output refers to the base directory of the project (`./src/`) and it uses the `near-operation-file` preset to generate a file per each operation found under `./src/**/*.graphql`.

The `presetConfig` section contains a key for setting the output files extension (in our case, `.generated.tsx` because of `react-apollo`), and the location of the base schema types file we created in the first section of this file (it will look for it in the base directory).
