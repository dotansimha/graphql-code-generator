GraphQL Code Generator also support presets - which is a way to manipulate and affect the execution of plugins.

Presets are CLI extensions, that allow manipulation of a `generates` section of codegen, based on custom logic.

You can use and writes presets to tell codegen which output files to creates, and what each one should include.
